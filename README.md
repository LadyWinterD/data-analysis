### **Project Showcase: Retail Data Analysis**

**Project Name**: Retail Gross Margin Analysis

**Project Objective**: This project aims to conduct a comprehensive gross margin analysis on retail data using Power BI to evaluate business performance and identify key insights.

**Technologies and Tools Used**:
* **Power BI**: Utilized for data visualization and creating interactive reports.
* **Power Query**: Employed for extracting and transforming data from the source.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to create custom measures and calculations to address different analytical requirements.

**Analysis Performed**:
* **Sales Overview**: Analyzed the total sales distribution between two retail chains, Fashions Direct and Lindseys.
* **Store Performance**: Compared the total sales and sales per square foot for new stores versus old stores across different months.
* **Geographical and Category Analysis**: Visualized sales by postal code and store type on a map, and analyzed the performance of various product categories.
* **District Manager Performance**: Evaluated the sales per square foot for each District Manager (DM).

**Project Outcomes**:
* Successfully developed a Power BI dashboard that clearly visualizes key business metrics.
* Identified that **Fashions Direct** is the dominant brand, contributing 71.01% of the total sales.
* Found that total sales from old stores consistently outperformed new stores, though new store sales showed significant growth in certain months.
* Determined the top-performing DM by sales per square foot, **Valery Ushakov** (\$14.90), and the top-performing store, **Winchester Fashions Direct** (\$21.22).
